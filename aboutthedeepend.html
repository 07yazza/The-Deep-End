  <ul>
    <li>What is Deeptech (quick def to help with what I've mapped)</li>
    <li>What was this project? Why did I do it?</li>
    <li>How to use this data/info: not fully complete but very extensive. What I've mapped and what I haven't. How I mapped it.</li>
    <li>If you want more info: request access to the spreadsheet with the raw data - free for everyone! But just need  you to request access to avoid people spamming the companies. And reach out to me if you have any questions or thoughts!</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Draft:<br>
    Deeptech is a company that commercialises scientific research. Like with any definitions that groups things together, there isn't one clear definition, and same goes for deeptech especially because of how science it can be. I believe the research can be across any field from arts to science.
