  <p>Draft:<br>
    Deeptech encompasses companies (specifically startups) that commercialise scientific research. Like with any definitions for groups, there isn't one distinct definition that's used across the industry, and same goes for deeptech, especially because of how varied science can be. For me, the research being commercialised from deeptech startups can be across any field from arts to science, but is largely based on a technology rather than a social solution.
    [Add these to the "What is Deeptech Blog and more info on what groups them and why that matters (and plug that link into this page):" The new technology offers a quantum leap in improvement over current solutions, which is distinct from optimisation or modifying the technology for an application (infrastructure vs application level of the technology).
    Usually these companies have ongoing research and development (R&D), a executive scientists in the founding team, deeptech is usually patentable IP (though not all patentable IP is deeptech), often works on physical products but also software (eg. AI), and has a long commercialisation pathway.]
    <br>I've always loved science (Chemistry & Materials in CleanTech and for Humanitarian solutions is my thing) and wanted to use entrepreneurship to commercialise research and see it through to making impact in the field.
    In addition to CleanTech, novel technologies are at the forefront of major disruptions to global challenges like climate, health and automation which will continue to grow in the coming years. 
    Many of these are physical problems that need innovative solutions, often distinctly different to current solutions that can't meet the needs of the donut [hyperlink to donut economics]. 
    As someone interested to be involved in the deeptech space, I couldn't find a lot of information readily. But there was a LOT going on.
    A lot of the work is happening at universities and corporates that not a lot of people would get to hear about unless if you were really in it.
    I sought to talk to people in the ecosystem to help me find out what's out there. I know there's more people like me, whether students, tinkerers, emerging deeptech founders, business wiz keen on the growing deeptech scence who would like to see what's around in deeptech in Australia.
    So with the help of a few mates and a long, rollercoaster journey getting this together, juggling between uni and work, I thought to put my learnings out here for others.
    I hope this work can inspire future deeptech entrepreneurs, help clarify the entrepreneurship pathways and opportunities, and help the broader ecosystem better support these entrepreneurs in the early stages - or just be an interesting read to go with your daily coffee.
