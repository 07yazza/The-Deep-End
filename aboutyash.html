<h3>Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm</h3> <h1>Yash Dave</h1>

<p style="text-align: center"><br><br><b>Iâ€™m driven to help reduce inequalities that hinder people to access

 <p>The science of <i>Chemistry & Materials</i> excites me in their role to challenge natural limitations from limited food and clean water to the environment. I enjoy tinkering with things and creating something new.</p>
 <p><i>ðŸš€ Entrepreneurship is a tool for me to create an impact with science.</i></p>
 <p>So I've been curious about what the journey of commercialising research looks like in Australia.</p>
 <p>The Deep End is one of the outputs of my curiousity, trying to understand more about this ecosystem. I've see the ecosystem is growing and more and more individuals, especially young scientists, are interested about research commercialisation, so I decided to share my research with you through this website. Hope you find this useful or interesting to ponder upon!ðŸŒŸ</p>
